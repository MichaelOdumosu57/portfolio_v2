# Summary

## Projects

## TODO

# Aspects

## Challenges
* figuuring out how to use APP_INITIALIZER DI token in angular so that we would not have to remove ngx-translate with another lib because of translateService.instant fn being synchronous 

* getting the footer and the body to align properly, it seems when you use flex-end in flex-direction column, things want to start from the bottom of the screen and if the content is bigger than the viewport it will overflow upwards



## Enjoyed
* making the site responsive, using new learnings to make mobile and regular nav


## Leadership

## Done Different
* ensured the wml-components were libraries not modules
* ensure that the label and error were components so I dont have to do i18n in javascript
